					HTML(HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)
		One helpful way of think about designing html websites is thinking about them like
a structure .Ä±f you re un familiar with tree structure effectively think of them as a com-
bination of nodes where nodes are just points within this tree that are connected to other
nodes. 
		So in this case , if look at a simple website like the HELLO WORLD page that we 
created before if wanted to represent this as a tree in HTML .We typically call that tree
the document object mode(DOM). .
