DOM(DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL )


Documents have a logical structure which is very much like a tree.
This tree contains the nodes (Which are optional - But must in DOM. Which means even if you dont write head tag DOM will add it)
Nodes are nothing but elements in our HTML markup.
The tree is so arranged that we can easily traverse any node in it
The traversing and the manipulation part is done using DOM API's.
