What's ORM(Object relational mapping)?
What's Flask-SQLALchemy ?

    In python we have this powerful language feature in Python .This objet-oriented programming syntax
that lets us create classes like Flight class.Define properties on those clases like the destination and 
duratin ; lets us define methods on those clases that let us add behavior or functionality to those classes -
the ability to add a passenger or the ability to delay a flight .

 And We also have in sort of a seperate world .. Our world of Sql databases or database of tables,
each one of which has some number of rows to which we can insert , or update ,or select, or delete from them .

        And What object relational mapping is going to allow us to do is tie those two worlds together. ıt's going to 
allow us to use Python clases and methods and objects to interact with a SQl database.

    In order to do that tie it with web applications written in Flask. We're foint to use a package called Flask "SQLALchemy" , which 
is a way of tying SQLALchemy, which we were using last time in order to write Python code that 
allowed us to execute database statements. And ıt's gonna make it easier to tie that in with a 
Flask application. So it's such that when users are using our Flask application, they can take advantage of more database features.

 The end goal here is to be able to use Python code and clases and object-oriented-programming
to be able to interact with our databases.
